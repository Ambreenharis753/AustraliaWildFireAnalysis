Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Dash, Folium 

Conducted exploratory data analysis on wildfire activity data (2005â€“present) across 7 regions of Australia to identify spatiotemporal fire patterns. 

Created multiple visualizations (line, bar, pie, histogram, scatter plots) to examine trends in fire area, brightness, radiative power, and confidence levels. 

Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to reveal that mean estimated fire brightness increased by ~30% in high-risk regions during peak months. 

Developed geospatial visualizations with Folium to map wildfire occurrences across Australia, highlighting regional severity zones. 

Built an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash allowing users to select Region and Year to dynamically view: 

Monthly average estimated fire area (pie chart) 

Monthly average vegetation fire counts (bar chart) 

Improved decision-making capabilities for environmental analysis by enabling real-time data exploration and region-based comparison. 

Demonstrated proficiency in data storytelling, dashboard interactivity, and environmental data visualization.
